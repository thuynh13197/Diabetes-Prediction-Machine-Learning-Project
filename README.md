# Diabetes-Prediction-Machine-Learning-Project
In this project, I developed a machine learning model using a Kaggle dataset to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on categorical factors. The project involves data exploration, preprocessing, and visualization to achieve an ~81% prediction accuracy based on determining whether or not a patient will have diabetes.
